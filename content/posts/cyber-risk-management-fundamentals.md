### Risk Management Overview

* NIST SP 800-30
  * Defines risk as “a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence”
* At a high level, this is accomplished by balancing exposure to risks against cost of mitigation and implementing appropriate countermeasures/controls.

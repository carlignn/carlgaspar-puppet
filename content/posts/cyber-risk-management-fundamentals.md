## Fundamentals of Cyber Risk Management

### Fundamentals of Cyber Risk Management Course Introduction

#### Course Agenda

* Risk Management Overview
* Risk Management Frameworks
* Critical Assets and Operations
* Threats and Vulnerabilities
* Risk Analysis and Mitigation
* Security Controls
* Mitigation Strategy Maintenance
* Response and Recovery

### Risk Management Overview

* NIST SP 800-30
  * Defines risk as “a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence”
* At a high level, this is accomplished by balancing exposure to risks against cost of mitigation and implementing appropriate countermeasures/controls.

#### Tiers of Risk Management

* Tier 1 – Organization (Governance)
* Tier 2 – Mission (Business Process)
* Tier 3 – Information System (Environment of Operations)

#### Terms to Know

* Response vs. Recovery
* Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk
* Risk Assessment
* Business Continuity Management
  * Risk Assessment
  * Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
  * Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

##### The Risk Equation

* Risk = Threat x (Likelihood x Vulnerability) x Impact

##### Risk Assessment

* A study of vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures

##### Business Continuity

##### Risk and Business Impact Analysis

* Know what is important to you.
  * What are your critical business functions?
* Know what threats you have.
* Know your vulnerabilities and the likelihood they get exploited.
* Know the impact to your business if the threat occurred.
* Analyze your risks.
  * Risk = Threat x (Likelihood x Vulnerability) x Impact
* Decide what to do about the risks.

##### Types of Risk

* Inherent Risk is the risk linked to a particular activity itself.
  * Complex regulations
  * Poor management
* Control Risk comes from a failure of the controls to properly mitigate risk.
  * Failure of firewall to block malicious traffic
* Residual Risk is the combination of the inherent and the control risk; it is what remains after the controls have been applied to mitigate risk.
  * Eliminating risk is not possible IF you have chosen to expose yourself to it.
  * Residual risk must be accepted by management.

##### Operational Resilience

* Resilience: The physical property of a material when it can return to its original shape or position after deformation that does not exceed its elastic limit
* Operational resilience: The emergent property of an organization that can continue to carry out its mission in the presence of operational stress and disruption that does not exceed its limit

##### Operational Resilience and Risk

* Operational resilience emerges from effective operational risk management.
* Operational risk categories
  * Actions of people
  * Systems and technology failures
  * Failed internal processes
  * External events

##### Elements of Resilience …

* You should focus on all three; do not ignore one for the others. (Venn Diagram)

Security (Mostly Physical Security, Life & Limb) + Business Continuity

Business Continuity (COOP, Redundancy, Back-ups) + IT Operations

IT Operations (Information Assurance, Network Security) + Security 

\= RESILIENCE

For many of us that works in Information Security, many of us sees risk as a negative thing. But risk is an essential part of a business. From **ISO/IEC 31000** - Risk is the effect of uncertainty on an objective. An effect is a deviation from the expected - positive and/negative.

## Risk Standards

* **ISO/IEC 31000** - Risk Management Principles and Guideline
* **ISO/IEC 27005** - Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Risk Management
* **NIST SP800-39** - Managing Information Security Risk
* **COBIT 5 for Risk**
* **NIST SP800-30 Rev 1** - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessment
* **HTRA** - Harmonized Threat and Risk Assessment

## Risk Management begins with:

* Knowing what has to be protected
  * Identification of assets
  * Determining asset value
* Understanding risk culture of the organization
  * Risk acceptance
  * Risk tolerance

## Risk Relative to Information Security Management

**Information Security Risk** is a potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization.

Strategic risk <-> Business risk <-> Information system (3)

## Implementation of Risk Management

* Obtain mandate and commitment from the management
* Design a risk management framework
  * Understand the organization
    * Unique requirements
* Implement risk management
* Monitor and review the risk framework
* Continuously improve the risk framework

## Elements of Risk Management

* **Policy** - what seems to be the most important to the organization
* **Resources** - people, budget
* **Accountability** - who is the owner of the risk
* **Integration into business processes** - integrating a risk culture to the business process
* **Reporting structure** - risk register, risk assessment report, audit report

**Risk management** works effectively when it is implemented based on a framework adapted to the needs of the organization and consistently applied.

## Risk Management Terminologies

* **Assets** - an item or property of value to its owner
  * Tangible - could be cash or money
  * Intangible - could be your reputation, name, morale
* **Asset Value** - the value of an asset is often affected by both internal and external factors
  * Value to business operations - example: the value of a hard drive failure effect on the business
  * Liability - breach or loss of data would be crucial
  * Value to an adversary - information of the company could be valuable to the competitors
  * Intellectual Property (IP) - patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets
* **IT Assets** - a major application, general support system, high impact program, physical plant, mission critical system, personnel, equipment, or a logically related group of systems
* **Threats** - any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact:
  * organizational operations,
  * organizational assets,
  * individuals,
  * other organizations, or
  * the Nation

  through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service
* **Threat Source** - element which alone, or in combination, has the potential to give rise to risk
* **Vulnerability** - weakness in:
  * an information system
  * system security procedures
  * internal controls
  * implementation

  that could be exploited by a threat source
* **Impact** - outcome of an event
* **Likelihood** - chance of something happening
* **Residual Risk** - risk that remains after risk treatment (after mitigating the risk down to an acceptable level)
* **Risk Acceptance** - the level of risk of the management is willing to tolerate

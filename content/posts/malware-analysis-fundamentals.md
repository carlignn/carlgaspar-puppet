* Vulnerability Management

## The Malware Analysis Process

**Obtain the malware > (Static Analysis \<> Dynamic Analysis) > Reporting**

Static Analysis - Analyzing malware without execution

Dynamic Analysis - Analyzing the behavior of malware through execution

### Focus Your Analysis

1. Is the file malicious?
2. How does the malware modify the system?
3. Who does the malware contact and why?
4. How can the malware be detected or removed?

### Packers

* Obfuscates program internals.
* May contain anti-analysis features.

## Hiding Your Virtual Machine

* Make the VM look as real as possible
* Install common end-user software
* Open multiple files and documents
* Don't install VM guest tools
* Trick the malware into thinking it is online

### VM Installation Checklist

* Install and run your analysis tools
* Set up host-only networking

On Alpine download page, you can choose the **Standard** or the **VM** version. I used the **VM** version in this setup since I will be installing it in Proxmox. Standard will work, too. I am really not sure what is the difference, aside from the slimmed down kernel as stated in their [WEBSITE](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/).

Once installed login using:

```shell
root
```

ffff

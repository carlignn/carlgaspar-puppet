## Introduction

Valorant is a free-to play FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it's like CS:GO but with abilities.

I played this game because I don't have anything to play at that time and the system requirements is pretty low and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.

## Experience

6 months from now, I started playing Valorant (June 2021), and today I reached Immortal 1. Now I'm part of the top 1.1% of players playing the game.

I got hooked because of the satisfying headshot sounds in-game.

Experience (PUT EXPERIENCE WITH TEAMMATES, PUT AGENTS USE ON EVERY MAP, ALSO TWITCH STREAMERS)

Iron 1-2 -  Pick Reyna, buy Odin, use ult, GG

Iron 3 - Started watching youtube videos about how to play THE GAME

Played Aim Labs training

At this time, I understand that it is possible to tap people heads and not just body shot them

Got impatient and always tilted and started coming back to odin

Bronze - Gold 1 - Went so fast(Yes, I reached g1 with odin)

Hardstuck at Gold 1, always getting 1 tapped by the enemy

Getback to my ass and started trying to hit heads with the Vandal

Hitting heads but still stuck at gold 1

Got back to youtube and learn the mechanics, just found out that you need to also move to avoid the enemy bullets. Learned counter strafing and different kinds of peeking which is also part of the mechanics

Reached Gold 3 - Still having a hard time getting to plat

Learned about the 3 most important things, mechanics, game sense and communication

Watched Twitch streamers(especially sinatraa - clearing angles, zombs, noted - counter strafing)

Learned double counter strafing, where I strafe, shoot; strafe, shoot; strafe, crouch, spray

Hard stuck plat 3, I understand the game sense and communication, but always getting inconsistent with the mechanics. Always getting 1 tapped.

No cover, always picking the losing angle, always ending up in the middle of the field

You don't have to always make flashy plays

What I learned in this game

The higher your rank is, the more toxic, prideful, and troll the most players are.

Everything has its mechanics. When you know the mechanics you'll tilt less.

I started playing csgo again and the mechanics is the same.

When I developed my game sense, I learned how to critically think in real life.

I started playing Dota 2 again and started owning.

How Valorant helped me to think critically

Mechanics also applies how to live your own life. The way I live my life now is very different because of playing this game. I learned that almost everything has it's own pattern. I'm now always trying to be conscious living my everyday life instead of living the ordinary repetitive unconscious everyday life. I have the sense of critical thinking,

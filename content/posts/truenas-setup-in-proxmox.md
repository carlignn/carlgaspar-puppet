From this guide, there's a comment [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3pKprTdNqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3pKprTdNqQ\&t=799s)

This video is really really the top of the iceberg. A few crucial thing is missing from this like:
\- excluding the disks from pve, or else you will wonder why it periodically interrupts disk operations or wakes up sleeping disks
\- disabling the "use tablet for pointer" as that in itself causes 10+% CPU load on the host side for some reason
\- disabling "hardware" acceleration of virtIO as this is known to cause problems
\- doing smart configuration (like APM, idle times) on the host side as the guest won't have access to smart data and alerts
\- optionally moving the system dataset to the boot disk

Drives were disconnecting randomly. Add this on Your host:Â cat /etc/modprobe.d/mpt3sas.conf

blacklist mpt3sas

Then

Full grub line: GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX\_DEFAULT="vfio-pci.ids=1000:0087 pcie\_acs\_override=downstream,multifunction"
